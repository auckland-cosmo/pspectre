version 20110613:
	- Fixed command-line parsing bug on Mac OS X
	- Added support for the monodromy potential
	- Added directional gradient outputs
	- Added various outputs in physical units
	- Added the option for full-precision outputs
	- Added power-law background expansion
	- Added the ability to read ICs from a file
	- Fixed the effective mass calculation in the LE-style ICs
	- Added an ICs mode cutoff 
	- Added phidot and chidot stats to the stats file
	- Added p (pressure) and w (e.o.s.) outputs to the energy file
	- Fixed the calculation of the initial H_0 guess
	- Fixed the calculation of program-unit phidot_0 and chidot_0 from
		the physical-unit inputs
	- Note: The input units of phidot_0 and chidot_0 were fixed; this makes all
		parameters files with non-zero values for these parameters
		incompatible with this new version!
	- Added an informational message when the simulation ends because
		the scale factor has passed the threshold value

version 20100913:
	- Fixed Defrost-style ICs normalization (again)
	- Fixed H_0 computation (included phidot dependence)
	- Included unnormalized (physical) averaged energy components in energy.tsv
	- Misc. makefile fixes related to the use of MKL
	- Included example oscillon parameter files
