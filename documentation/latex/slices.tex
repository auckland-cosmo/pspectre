Binary slices are optionally generated for many different variables.

Single-\/precision floating point format is used regardless of the precision used for computation. The \char`\"{}length\char`\"{} parameter indicates the length of the side of the grid from which the slice is taken, {\bfseries not} the size of the output slice if \char`\"{}skip\char`\"{} is $>$ 0. \char`\"{}skip\char`\"{} is the number of grid points inbetween output points. If averaging is active, the skipped points are averaged over instead of actually being skipped.
